# zelda-clone-in-kaboomJS
My first project using KaboomJS. Please Nintendo, don't sue me.

To play, just open the Index file on your browser.

I'll keep updating and adding new levels, enemies and stuff to this project as time goes on, right now i'm working on Link's combat.

*Kaboom is a Javascript library, check out the [documentation](https://kaboomjs.com) to learn more about it.

*Ania Kub√≥w has a great tutorial on how to make one of those in her [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw), so shout out to her.
